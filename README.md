# DEMOLITIONIST Radio

This is a playlist mod originally created for personal use, but I think it'd be alright for it to be publicly available.

Everything's still a work in progress, there are some quirks here and there, but it's usable. The base comes with no playlists, you'd basically have to make those yourself.

I do have my own personal lists, but for copyright reasons I can only distribute two of them:
 - **[Demo's Scene Mix](https://marisakirisa.me/tmp/swwmgz_music_demo_m.pk3)**: Created specifically for the **Codename: DEMOLITIONIST** mod *(hence the name of this project)*, containing a collection of tracker music, usually demoscene-related, along with tracks from the Unreal series and such.
 - **[Meido's Overclocked Re-Mixtape](https://marisakirisa.me/tmp/swwmgz_music_meido_m.pk3)**: A semi-curated collection of various tracks from **[OverClocked ReMix](https://ocremix.org/)** which, as one would expect due to in-universe circumstances, lacks remixes of **Doom** tracks.

In order to create your own playlists, you can use mine as reference, the process isn't all too complicated.
